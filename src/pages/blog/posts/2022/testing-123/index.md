What the hell is a gigawatt? Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. Huh? No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids. I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy.

No. Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row. Watch it, Goldie. Never? you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin.

Stop it. He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life. Yeah, well history is gonna change. Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.

I'll call you tonight. I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? Uh, coast guard. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand?

It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple. I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf. Well, she's not doing a very good job.

Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody. A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. Oh, yeah, yeah. Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works. Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life.

Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy. Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her.
