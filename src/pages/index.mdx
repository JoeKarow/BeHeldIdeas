    Who's are these? Save the clock tower, **save the clock tower**. Mayor
    Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago,
    lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the
    Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the
    way it is as part of our history and heritage. I can't play. A block passed
    Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. Uh, Lorraine. How did you know I was
    here?


    Uh, yeah. Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. *Do you have a television?* Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody. Yeah, who are you? Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. ***Run for it, Marty.***
